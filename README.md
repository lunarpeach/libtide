# libtide

Miscellaneous C++ headers that have seen some use in my hobby projects.


## Usage

This is a personal project, and I only intend to maintain it as far as free time
and interest allow.  Having said that, please feel free to use any bits of this
that seem useful.  Information about what each header does and how to use it *should*
live in the comments at the top of each file.


## Requirements

C++17 support.  I'm building with `-std=c++17` for now, but intend to move to
`-std=c++20` in the future.
