# libtide

Miscellaneous C++ headers that have seen some use in my hobby projects.


## Usage

Information about what each header does and how to use it *should* live in the
comments at the top of each file.  Grab one that seems useful, and use it
directly in your project.  Tweak it, improve it, and, if you want, share what
you changed.  I'm always ready to learn something new.


## Requirements

C++17 support.  I'm building with `-std=c++17` for now, but intend to move to
`-std=c++20` in the future.
